# Taxi_Geospatial_Data
 
This project focuses on visualizing GPS coordinates from a series of trips using Python and Folium. The dataset includes detailed information about each trip, such as the trip ID, call type, timestamp, start location, end location, and a polyline representing the route taken.
This project demonstrates my ability to handle geospatial data, perform data transformations, and create interactive visualizations, making complex data accessible and understandable.
